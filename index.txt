*WLib* (official pronunciation -- /wi&#720;l&#618;b/), or *WLibC*, or *WC* -- is a standard-independent <<library,library>> written _the C Programming Language ("C")_, that consists of several _modules_ (library files / source directories, and header files) that can be used either as an alternative to or an addition of _the C standard library_ (a.k.a libc or stdlib), depending on the edition installed/configuration at built-time. This library is free of charge and {REPO}[open-source] with focus on minimalism and optimization on all levels (execution speed, memory usage, storage occupation, etc.).

== Requirements

If you want to use our library to write your own code, your compiler should comply with the only requirements: ANSI C / ISO C / ISO C++ (all of any revision) standard support (while there are efforts to support K&R C compilers, like `pcc`, however, you are on your own);

== Installation
=== Building from the source code
If you want to make a personally-configured build of our library or if you just feel like building from source, follow next steps. *(Currently this is the only way to get a copy of our library)*

==== 1. Acquire the source code
To acquire the source code you can either clone the Git repository or checkout the needed module source code files in your terminal.

===== Clone the repository
====== Through HTTPS
.With Git
[source,sh]
git clone https://github.com/wspvlv/wlib.git [PATH]

.With SVN
[source,sh]
svn checkout https://github.com/wspvlv/wlib.git [PATH]

====== Through SSH
[source,sh]
git clone git@github.com:wspvlv/wlib.git [PATH]

===== Checkout a single folder
[source,sh]
svn checkout https://github.com/wspvlv/wlib.git/trunk/[FOLDER] [PATH]

==== 2. Build the needed modules using Make
There's a Makefile in the repository, which contains targets for quickly building or compiling the modules.
[source,sh]
make [MODULE]
